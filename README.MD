## Introduction

In the age of information overload, having a reliable system for retrieving and generating accurate data is essential. HomebrewAgenticAI offers a solution by combining the strengths of LLMs with a self-correcting agentic loop. This allows the system to dynamically refine answers through tool usage and validation. 

## Features

- **Local LLMs**: Utilize Ollama to run language models locally, ensuring privacy and speed.
- **Intelligent Crawling**: Automatically crawl documentation to gather relevant information.
- **Summarization**: Generate concise summaries from extensive documents.
- **Vector Embeddings**: Store and retrieve information efficiently with Supabase.
- **Self-Correcting Loop**: The system learns and improves answers based on feedback and tool interactions.
- **Robust Information Retrieval**: Access accurate data tailored to your needs.

## Installation

To set up HomebrewAgenticAI on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/P-tor/HomebrewAgenticAI.git
   cd HomebrewAgenticAI
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. You can install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Supabase**:
   - Create a Supabase account if you donâ€™t have one.
   - Set up a new project and obtain your API keys.
   - Update the configuration file with your Supabase details.

4. **Run the Application**:
   Start the application using the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with it through the command line or a web interface, depending on your setup. Hereâ€™s a quick guide on how to use some of the main features:

### Crawling Documentation

To crawl documentation, simply provide the URL of the document you wish to analyze. The system will extract the relevant sections and store them for later use.

```bash
crawl --url <DOCUMENT_URL>
```

### Summarization

To generate a summary from the crawled documents, use the summarize command. The system will return a concise overview of the information.

```bash
summarize --id <DOCUMENT_ID>
```

### Self-Correction

If you notice any inaccuracies in the responses, you can provide feedback to the system. This feedback will help the agentic loop refine its answers over time.

```bash
feedback --id <RESPONSE_ID> --correct <CORRECT_ANSWER>
```
